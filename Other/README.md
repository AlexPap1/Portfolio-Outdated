Images of applications without github repo's have no links attached intentionally

Contact me links should open phone, email, and linkedin with prompts to contact

Links in nav remain purple. Not intentional, but didn't think it needed adjustment

git logo image isn't centered on my monitor, but shows centered in inspect tool for all screens I could find

images are transparent to avoid box framing

profile picture at ~35% size to keep bio from extending too long

removed bullets from my work list
