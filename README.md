This site is designed to showcase my work in software development while also introducing myself as an individual

I included links to the "About Me", "My Work", and "Contact Me" sections to make the site easier to navigate.

**About ME**

In the About Me seciton, I added a recent photo of myself as well as a short paragraph about myself including my education history, my interests/hobbies, and my desire to get into software development.

**My Work**

In the My Work Section, I added images of the projects I have worked on prior to the portfoilio, with links to those portfilios where appliable.

**Contact Me**

The Contact Me section includes my email, phone, and LinkedIn. Where each link will send the reader to their phone, email, or LinkedIn apps with a direct to my contact. This was done to make it easier to contact me and also to make sure there was nothing lost in transcribing my information into those respective apps.

**My Notes to Self**

Images of applications without github repo's have no links attached intentionally

Contact me links should open phone, email, and linkedin with prompts to contact

Links in nav remain purple. Not intentional, but didn't think it needed adjustment

git logo image isn't centered on my monitor, but shows centered in inspect tool for all screens I could find

images are transparent to avoid box framing

profile picture at ~35% size to keep bio from extending too long

removed bullets from my work list
